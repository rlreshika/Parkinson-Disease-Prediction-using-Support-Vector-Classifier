# 🧠Parkinson-Disease-Prediction-using-Support-Vector-Classifier
➡️This project has 2 ipynb files viz **main.ipynb** and **final.ipynb**. final.ipynb can be found inside Final folder. 
main.ipynb contains all the algorithms with various feature selection techniques which are used for comparitive analysis . Among those algorithms best performing algorithm is selected based on **f1 score** and **auc score**. The selected model with feature selection techniques is then neatly presented in final.ipynb.
This project uses **9** machine learning algorithms combined with **3** feature selection techniques for comparitive analysis.
#### 🤖 Machine learning algorithms used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Gradient Boosting
3. AdaBoost Classifier
4. XGBoost Classifier
5. Logistic Regression
6. Decision Tree Classifier
7. Support Vector Classifier
9. Random Forest Classifier
10. Naive Bayes Classifier 
#### 📈Feature selection techniques used:
1. Variance Thresholding
2. Informatino Gain
3. Particle Swarm Optimization
4. Genetic Algorithm
#### **It has been found that Support Vector Classifier is doing best job with f1_score = 0.97, auc score = 0.93 and testing accuracy = 0.95 with training time = 0.22 seconds**
Flowchart of the workflow is attached in the screenshot section
